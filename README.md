# SA-Legal-Solutions-Automation-Sheet
Automations built behind SA Legal's Google Sheet automation hub. Contract started 12-20-19.

## SA Legal Automation Station Usage Tips
- New depositions should be added via the sidebars that can be activated by making a selection in the ⚖️ SA Legal Services menu, not by adding information directly to the "Schedule a depo" Sheet. 
- **Nobody** should edit the layout of the "Schedule a depo" Sheet. Many of the automations depend on the layout of this Sheet remaining the way it is.
- If someone is using the Automation Station to add or modify depositions (or the Google Calendar events associated with them), the email address they're logged in with will need to have full access ("Make changes and manage sharing") to Blake's Services Google Calendar.

### Layout Changes to SA Legal Automation Station v2
1. Added Status column (column A) to the "Schedule a depo" Sheet. This can be used to change the status of depositions, which will make changes to the Services Google Calendar and to the "Current List" Sheet.
2. Added Event ID column (column AK) to the "Schedule a depo" Sheet. The data in this column *should not be modified*--it is automatically generated and used to link depositions with specific events on the Services Google Calendar.
